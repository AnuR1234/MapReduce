Are you building your personal brand with book authorship and want to make sure you knock it out of the park? Your book needs a website like never before.

It’s going to be an extension of your personal brand, the hub of the content you create and a destination for each and every member of the network you’re building to share your message with the world.

“But wait,” you might say, “My book will be on Amazon. My publisher is going to handle promotion, plus I have all kinds of stuff going on in social media channels. Do I really need a website too?”

You do and it needs to be ‘ATTENTION GRABBING.”

The content you post on social media networks belongs to those networks. You need to own your brand and the ability to purposefully direct it. You do that first and foremost with your website, which allows you to:

    Project yourself the way you want, in a way you control
    Highlight the best aspects of your book
    Stand out from those you compete with
    Globalize your reach
    Create connections with like-minded people
    Create a calling card that’s far more compelling than a business card

This post showcases the best personal-branded book author websites on the market today. Be sure to let me know if I missed any this should be on this list.
